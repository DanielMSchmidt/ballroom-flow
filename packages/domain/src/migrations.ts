// US-013 — Migration ladder (schemaVersion envelope) (PLAN §2.1, §7, §10.2).
//
// Every document carries a `schemaVersion`. `migrate` walks an ORDERED ladder of
// per-version upgrade steps from the doc's version up to CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION,
// so an older doc (e.g. from a JSON import, US-048) is brought current one step
// at a time. Migrating a doc that's already current is a no-op.
//
// FORWARD-COMPATIBLE: a migration step transforms STRUCTURE only — it must never
// drop or rewrite unknown attribute *values* (an unknown value from a newer
// client survives the round-trip, §10.2; a value-touching step must itself be a
// US-012-style lenient transform). And it MUST NOT rewrite the immutable identity
// fields `figureType` or `dance` (tasks #91/#92): a figure copies both from its
// base at creation (US-008) and family-note matching (US-011) + visibility
// (US-041) depend on them being stable for life. The ladder enforces this — a
// step that changes either throws.
//
// There are no schema changes yet, so CURRENT is 1 and the ladder is empty — but
// the machinery is in place so a future v2 step plugs in with TWO localized edits
// in this file (add a `MIGRATIONS[1]` entry AND bump CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 2),
// with no caller changes.
